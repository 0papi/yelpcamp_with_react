# Some Tasks To Do

1. Whenever the app launches, check to see if user is already authenticated
2. If user has registered or logged in before, automatically log them in and redirect to appropriate route
3. When user opens single campground, it shouldnt matter whether they're authenticated or not
4. In addition to the above, if user isn't authenticated, do not display delete button
5. The above functionality should apply to reviews as well. Only display delete button on reviews to viewers who are authenticated.
